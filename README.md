# 🎥Unsupervised Face-Clustering Pipeline
🧠Distributed Video Face Clustering Pipeline using Unsupervised Learning 
A scalable computer vision system that processes video footage, extracts facial embeddings, and automatically groups similar faces using clustering techniques. Designed with multithreaded processing and production-ready job-based architecture



## 🚀Features

🎞️ Video frame extraction

🧑 Face detection using deep learning models

🔢 Face embedding generation

🧩 Unsupervised face clustering using DBSCAN

⚡ Multithreaded processing pipeline

📂 Automatic grouped face storage

🖼️ Face montage generation

🗂️ Job-based output architecture

📊 Logging and error monitoring


## 🛠️Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV
NumPy
dlib / face_recognition
Scikit-learn
pyPiper (Multithreading Pipeline)
tqdm (Progress tracking)
Logging (Monitoring)



## Installation

 Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn dlib face_recognition imutils pyPiper tqdm
```



## 🧩Clustering Method
This project uses DBSCAN clustering, which:
Does not require labeled data
Automatically detects number of unique individuals
Groups faces based on embedding similarity
## 📊 Output Example
Each folder represents one detected identity cluster.
```bash
ClusteredFaces/
   ├── Face_0/
   ├── Face_1/
   ├── Face_2/
   └── Montage/
```
## 💼 Real World Applications
Surveillance analytics

Event media tagging

Identity grouping in video datasets

Dataset creation for supervised training

Security and monitoring systems
